s6\SI1037\The revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform.
s6\SI1089\Perhaps things were even worse then.
s6\SI1092\Yet we no longer feel uneasy.
s6\SI1093\What elements of our behavior are decisive?
s6\SI1099\This does not allow the mystery to invade us.
s6\SI1120\His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence.
s6\SI1133\It can project long-range goals for itself.
s6\SI1164\Otherwise, the outlook could be dark indeed.
s6\SI1186\Questions came to me from all sides about my world citizenship activities.

s6\SI1646\Your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary.
s6\SI1663\He thought he saw a pale face at a window.
s6\SI1685\Come on, let's hurry down before they lock up for the day.
s6\SI1719\We've done our part.
s6\SI1735\And possessed himself -- how?
s6\SI1745\This one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more.
s6\SI1795\He shrugged casually.
s6\SI1798\We'll both be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you.
s6\SI1806\Shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first?
s6\SI1821\These planets were much bigger, nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere.
s6\SI1844\Hello, anyone at home?
s6\SI1868\They neither gained nor fell back.
s6\SI1908\After another long pause he asked, how many people know who they are?
s6\SI1934\Wait a little while.
s6\SI1967\Twelve o'clock level.
s6\SI1978\Something pulled my leg.
s6\SI1997\Like as if it were built of books.
s6\SI2000\We can get it if we dig, he said patiently.
s6\SI2058\Why ain't you playin' ball?
s6\SI2093\He then offered his own estimate of the weather, which was unenthusiastic.
s6\SI2095\My dad did it, and he lived to a great age.
s6\SI2137\The eye is all, inward or outward.
s6\SI2146\But it was a hopeful sign, he told himself.
s6\SI2205\She saw me and sat down beside me, three feet away.
s6\SI2221\This is a sleeping capsule.
s6\SI2229\How's your sunburn now?
s6\SI2259\The tale, he thought, would become less gay.
s6\SI2271\Add things as you find you need 'em.
s6\SI2290\Ambiguity arises when the pronoun "it" carries a twofold reference.
s6\SI2304\Now he's bought it, said my wife contentedly.
s6\SI2316\Davy Mathews! It's disgusting, the way you're always eating!
s6\SI2333\You're to report back to headquarters at once.

s16\SI901\Milk appears twice a day.
s16\SI929\But such cases were, in the past, unusual.
s16\SI1028\But now she sank lower to the rock.
s16\SI1043\Not surprisingly, this approach did not work.
s16\SI1122\His successors have adopted the opposite alternative.
s16\SI1124\Let me quote him even more fully, for his analysis is important to my theme.
s16\SI1210\As we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable.
s16\SI1216\Let us now give some thought to the soul.
s16\SI1257\Forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business.
s16\SI1373\Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form list.
s16\SI1407\Within a month, calls were up seventy per cent.
s16\SI1446\In earlier years, the preservation of food was essentially related to survival.
s16\SI1486\The fear of punishment just didn't bother him.
s16\SI1499\It was like finally getting into one's own nightmares to punish one's dreams.
s16\SI1514\Maybe they'll stop it now, once for all.
s16\SI1527\They'll toe the line.
s16\SI1546\In the pity for them his loneliness was gone.
s16\SI1550\Maybe today'll be a good-news day.
s16\SI1589\No, she would not pretend modesty, but neither must she be crudely bold.
s16\SI1624\We came on as soon as we could.
s16\SI1660\The car door crashed shut.
s16\SI1678\Twice he nearly fell.
s16\SI1690\Hey, come back, he shouted.
s16\SI1712\You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces?
s16\SI1749\Nevertheless it's true.
s16\SI1750\Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared?
s16\SI1773\The room looked normal and even commonplace.
s16\SI1779\They used pink, tan, or cream powder.
s16\SI1797\C'mon, he whispered; floor level's about three feet down, so don't fall.
s16\SI1828\Actually, they said, he did sleep, but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot.
s16\SI1856\Her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him.
s16\SI1861\My dress needs some work on it.
s16\SI1865\Now there's nothin left of me.
s16\SI1933\Beat me to death in front of a hundred people.
s16\SI1964\The pilots' heads looked ridiculously small.
s16\SI1968\The opposing aircraft continued to come on.
s16\SI2019\Later, you shall know it better.
s16\SI2025\He didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself.
s16\SI2047\Stay right here where you are, kid, he called.
s16\SI2051\He'll shoot up the town.
s16\SI2080\He would not carry a brief case.
s16\SI2086\Absolution for his lie?
s16\SI2119\The instinct of discipline has been lost.
s16\SI2154\She must have put his clothes in the closet.
s16\SI2186\Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough.
s16\SI2204\Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick.
s16\SI2292\Is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal?
s16\SI2319\Maybe they're delivering the desk now!
s16\SI2328\Oh Mother, I saw them!
s17\SA1\She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year.

s45\SI1237\We may say of some unfortunates that they were never young.
s45\SI1291\They should live in modest circumstances, avoiding all conspicuous consumption.
s45\SI1339\Of particular importance is the study of the actions of drugs in this respect.
s45\SI1363\Some of these speculations may have some merit, others are somewhat ambiguous.
s45\SI1387\Several factors contributed to this change.
s45\SI1395\The elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups.
s45\SI1403\In what ways, then, did the patient's psychical blindness manifest itself?
s45\SI1409\Surely there is nothing new about communism.
s45\SI1418\Personal predispositions tend to blunt the ear and, in turn, the voice as well.
s45\SI1450\Meats: the radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation.
s45\SI1461\Measured performance characteristics for this experimental tube will be listed.
s45\SI1479\Have you got enough blankets?
s45\SI1482\It could take place tomorrow night, or it might occur months from now.
s45\SI1485\The other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers.
s45\SI1516\The word also made him feel hate, sincere hate, for those so labeled.
s45\SI1529\Merely to satisfy the author's curiosity.
s45\SI1572\He found an empty bench, opened a newspaper, and stretched his legs before him.
s45\SI1630\Next, the hen was nested and all seemed well.
s45\SI1668\Oh, no, not again, he said aloud.
s45\SI1713\He may try to phone us.
s45\SI1746\His salary had reached the ten thousand mark.
s45\SI1754\He said: the crazy fool, half aloud.
s45\SI1796\His eyes burned feverishly.
s45\SI1813\You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me.
s45\SI1853\Thus events occurred, and victims changed in appearance, and new ones arrived.
s45\SI1859\We'll work for our keep, the boy said eagerly.
s45\SI1877\There's no chance now of all of us getting away.
s45\SI1895\It might hurt you, though.
s45\SI1899\You took me by surprise.
s45\SI2063\To his surprise his plan worked perfectly.
s45\SI2114\Stake me, she said, and let me at those dice.
s45\SI2155\He was kneeling to tie his shoelaces.
s45\SI2158\For a moment he felt like a thief discovered.
s45\SI2198\But if she wasn't interested, she'd just go back to the same life she'd left.
s45\SI2208\Yes, because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush.
s45\SI2225\Run-down, iron-poor.
s45\SI2234\Nobody else did, either.
s45\SI2245\He could take the advice or leave it.
s45\SI2263\Nobody else showed pleasure.
s45\SI2279\Officials meet on rubbish.
s45\SI2284\A woman met a famous author at a literary tea.
s45\SI2298\As a result, he was persuaded out to dinner.
s45\SI2330\I'm going to search this house.
s46\SA1\She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year.
s46\SA2\Don't ask me to carry an oily rag like that.
s46\SX228\The viewpoint overlooked the ocean.
s46\SX365\The gunman kept his victim cornered at gunpoint for three hours.
s46\SI562\Family loyalties and cooperative work have been unbroken for generations.
s46\SI576\But even mother's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior.
s46\SI618\He talked about unauthentic storylines too.
s46\SI629\His technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully.
s46\SI710\However, the aircraft which we have today are tied to large, soft airfields.
s46\SI863\Check your cafeteria location to make sure it's convenient for most employees.
s46\SI1070\Do you always navigate like this?
s46\SI1177\In some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality.
s46\SI1358\But the information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading.
s46\SI1455\The single curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example.
s46\SI1463\We can, however, maximize its expected value.
s46\SI1525\Maybe they already got them.
s46\SI1552\Outside, only a handful of reporters remained.
s46\SI1704\You're a taxpayer, householder, landlord.
s46\SI1733\He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities.
s46\SI2145\Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance?
s46\SX6\Bright sunshine shimmers on the ocean.
s46\SX8\Why yell or worry over silly items?
s46\SX14\Before Thursday's exam, review every formula.
s46\SX25\Only lawyers love millionaires.
s46\SX31\A good attitude is unbeatable.
s46\SX36\Only the most accomplished artists obtain popularity.
s46\SX38\Young people participate in athletic activities.
s46\SX43\Elderly people are often excluded.
s46\SX56\Academic aptitude guarantees your diploma.
s46\SX61\Chocolate and roses never fail as a romantic gift.
s46\SX64\Regular attendance is seldom required.
s46\SX67\Last year's gas shortage caused steep price increases.
s46\SX68\Upgrade your status to reflect your wealth.
s46\SX73\Cliff's display was misplaced on the screen.
s46\SX78\Doctors prescribe drugs too freely.
s46\SX80\It's illegal to postdate a check.
s46\SX82\Good service should be rewarded by big tips.
s46\SX100\Project development was proceeding too slowly.
s46\SX134\December and January are nice months to spend in Miami.
s46\SX140\Agricultural products are unevenly distributed.
s46\SX151\The previous speaker presented ambiguous results.
s46\SX170\The Mayan neoclassic scholar disappeared while surveying ancient ruins.
s46\SX180\Almost all colleges are now coeducational.
s46\SX197\Draw each graph on a new axis.
s46\SX206\When peeling an orange, it is hard not to spray juice.
s46\SX227\It's healthier to cook without sugar.
s46\SX229\Are you looking for employment?
s46\SX233\Highway and freeway mean the same thing.
s46\SX260\Remember to allow identical twins to enter freely.
s46\SX287\In the long run, it pays to buy quality clothing.
s46\SX292\These exclusive documents must be locked up at all times.
s46\SX297\Rock-and-roll music has a great rhythm.
s46\SX311\My desires are simple: give me one informative paragraph on the subject.
s46\SX355\Dolphins are intelligent marine mammals.
s46\SX385\His shoulder felt as if it were broken.
s46\SX389\They own a big house in the remote countryside.
s46\SX400\Just drop notices in any suggestion box.
s46\SX403\Her wardrobe consists of only skirts and blouses.
s46\SX427\Every cab needs repainting often.
s46\SX452\In developing film, many toxic chemicals are used.
s46\SI463\The hotel owner shrugged.
s46\SI466\Then we'd really have someplace to go.
s46\SI526\We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation.
s46\SI698\The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me.
s46\SI773\Let all projects dry slowly for several days.
s46\SI802\They're easier to shade there.
s46\SI844\Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience.
s46\SI905\His work began just six days after the flood.
s46\SI939\Impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value.
s46\SI943\Production may fall far below expectations.
s46\SI944\If the farm is rented, the rent must be paid.
s46\SI955\Worse, his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before.
s46\SI967\He not only knew soldiering, but mathematics, history and literature as well.
s46\SI1025\Nice country to meet a lion in face to face.
s46\SI1057\Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster?
s46\SI1091\Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought.
s46\SI1137\His name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty.
s46\SI1146\We knew that it was, as reassurance, the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature.
s46\SI1147\Civilization is what man has made of himself.
s46\SI1148\Change involves the displacement of form.
s46\SI1169\They despised foreigners.
s46\SI1188\Maybe they will take us.
s46\SI1191\All chance of fulfilling my destiny is over.
s46\SI1255\My sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today.
s46\SI1292\Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach.
s46\SI1360\It provides a frame for the sampling census.
s46\SI1370\We may say that his problem was diagnosed but that he refused treatment.
s46\SI1375\Often, dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion.
s46\SI1401\He holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval.
s46\SI1411\Resolved that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action.
s46\SI1515\They're doin' it now.
s46\SI1556\He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said: now what do we do?
s46\SI1607\He travelled all over the world.
s46\SI1611\That is what childhood is, he told himself.
s46\SI1640\How did one join them?
s46\SI1661\Do you know where it might have gone?
s46\SI1667\He held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible.
s46\SI1714\Here's where luck would normally step in.
s46\SI1736\The poor, unlucky -- the telephone rang.
s46\SI1740\Probably around midnight, give or take an hour either way.
s46\SI1787\It's perhaps a mile from here where we sit.
s46\SI1791\No, the man was not drunk; he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger.
s46\SI1815\Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches.
s46\SI1852\Soon, said the half-man.
s46\SI1862\We'll pay you back if you'll let us.
s46\SI1905\Meanwhile spring had passed well into summer.
s46\SI1950\Does this make it any easier, coward?
s46\SI1994\So if all these beers was to get me in bed, man, you just spent a lot of money.
s46\SI1996\You shall see her at dinner.
s46\SI2011\At least, the wheels dug in.
s46\SI2078\Or the bay of female dogs in heat.
s46\SI2082\You're boiling milk, ain't you?
s46\SI2091\No temptation, no virtue?
s46\SI2131\You had to be stupid or crazy or immortal.
s46\SI2144\Why are you trying to worry me?
s46\SI2162\His voice seemed thick and purposeless.
s46\SI2187\He daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around.
s46\SI2191\She didn't even give me a chance to refuse.
s46\SI2273\It all seemed rather hopeless.
s46\SI2286\Yes, sir, she said, is that definite?
s47\SA1\She had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year.
s47\SA2\Don't ask me to carry an oily rag like that.
